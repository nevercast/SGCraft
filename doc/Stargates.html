<h1>Stargates</h1>
A stargate is a transportation device developed by a long-vanished
alien civilisation known as the Ancients. Their vast network of
stargates was later taken over by the Goa'uld, a race of nasty sentient
parasites. The Goa'uld brought stargate technology to Earth, enslaved
the ancient Egyptians, and then largely lost interest in us. The only
traces remaining of them on Earth now are their influence on Egyptian
culture and a few pieces of mysterious technology.<br>
<br>
How the stargate works is not known in detail,
but it appears to create a space-time wormhole linking it to another
stargate in a distant location. Once the wormhole is established, a
person can step into one stargate and be instantly transported to the
other.<br>

<br>

A network of stargates is similar in some ways to a telephone network.
Each stargate has an address, and you establish a connection by
dialling the address of the stargate you want to connect to.<br>

<h2>Stargate Components</h2>Stargates are built from components that
may be found in various places in the world. You will sometimes find
stargate components in chests in dungeons and other structures, and
occasionally you may even come across a complete stargate. Some
components can also be crafted, but not all. In particular, the circuit
crystals that form the heart of certain key stargate components are
beyond our ability to replicate; these may only be found in the world
or purchased from a <a href="TokraVillager.html">Tok'ra villager</a>.<br>
<h2>Building a Stargate</h2>


<img style="width: 360px; height: 160px;" class="float-right" src="StargatePattern.png" alt="">To create a stargate, you need to build a 5x5 ring composed of a
Stargate Base Block, eight Stargate Ring Blocks and seven Stargate
Chevron Blocks, arranged in the patter shown here. The blue circle on
the base block should face the direction you want the front of the
stargate to be in; the direction of the other blocks doesn't matter.<br>

<br>

Once the last block is placed, the blocks of the ring will merge
together and form a Stargate.<br>

<h2>Stargate Controller</h2>
To use your stargate, you will need a Stargate Controller, also known
as a DHD or Dial Home Device. The controller should be placed facing
the front of the stargate, within 5 blocks of the bottom centre of the
ring, either on the same level or one block above or below.<br>

<br>
<img style="width: 341px; height: 240px;" class="float-right" src="StargateAndController.png" alt="">
Right-clicking on the controller will bring up a GUI for entering a
stargate address. If the controller is properly linked to a stargate,
the central button in the GUI will be orange. If it is grey, your controller is
too far from the stargate or facing the wrong way.<br>

<br>

An address can be entered either by clicking buttons on the circular
grid or typing letters on the keyboard. The Backspace or Delete key can
be used to erase characters. Once a complete address is entered, press
the Enter key or click on the orange button. If the address is valid,
the orange button will light up and the stargate will begin dialling
the address.<br>

<br>

Once a stargate connection is made, it can be disconnected by pressing
the orange button again.<br>

<h2>Stargate Addressing</h2>

A stargate address is made up of seven characters, chosen from an
alphabet of 26 symbols. For convenience, these symbols have been
somewhat arbitrarily mapped to letters, so that you can type them on
your keyboard.<br>

<br>

The address encodes a dimension and a spatial location within that
dimension. The location has chunk-level resolution, meaning that you
can only have one useful stargate in each chunk (16x16 area). If you
dial the address of a chunk containing more than one stargate, one of
them will be connected to arbitrarily.<br>

<br>

To find out the address of a stargate, right-click somewhere on the ring. <span style="font-style: italic;">This is temporary; finding out stargate
addresses may be more complicated in a future version.</span><br>

<h2>Powering Stargates</h2><img style="width: 48px; height: 48px;" class="float-right" src="NaquadahOre300.png" alt="">Before your stargate will do anything, it needs to be supplied with
fuel. 

Stargates run on <span style="font-style: italic;">naquadah</span>, a
dense mineral of unknown composition that is a very rich source of energy<a href="#naq-energy"><sup>1</sup></a>.
Naquadah is obtained from <span style="font-style: italic;">naquadah ore</span>,
which is most commonly found underneath lava, although it occasionally
appears in other places. Due to its very high density, a
diamond pickaxe is required to mine naquadah.<br>
<br>
To fuel a stargate, open its GUI by right-clicking somewhere on the stargate ring (not the
controller) and place naquadah in the fuel slots at the right. The
black rectangle is a fuel buffer that will be automatically refilled as
necessary from the fuel slots.<br>

<br>Establishing a connection requires a fairly large burst of energy,
and energy is also used as long as the connection remains open. If you
don't keep the stargate open for longer than necessary, one
piece of naquadah is good for about 20 journeys. If you leave the gate open, it closes automatically after 5
minutes.<br>

<br>

Fuel is only used by the stargate initiating the connection. No fuel is
required to receive a connection or maintain a received connection.<br>

<br>

<span style="font-style: italic;">Future versions may provide
alternative ways of both powering and controlling stargates.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">

<h2>Safety Precautions</h2>

The opening transient of a stargate event horizon is extremely
dangerous. It is recommended to maintain a distance of at least 5
blocks from the front of the stargate until the event horizon
stabilises.<br>

<br>

Breaking a stargate while a connection is open is not recommended. The
event horizon contains a large amount of potential energy; if the
stargate mechanism is disrupted, this energy will be explosively
released.<br>
