<h1>SG-1 Canon</h1>
In the interests of making stargates a practical transportation device
in Minecraft, not all details of SG-1 canon are strictly followed.
Configuration options are provided to change some of these if you want
a more authentic SG-1 experience.<br>
<h2>Travelling Direction</h2>
In SG-1, matter is only able to travel in one direction through a
stargate wormhole, from the initiating to the receiving gate. By
default, SG Craft stargates permit travel in either direction. This can
be changed using the <span style="font-family: monospace;">oneWayTravel</span> configuration option.<br>
<h2>Closing Connections</h2>
In SG-1, only the initiating stargate is able to close a wormhole. By
default, SG Craft allows a connection to be closed from either end.
This can be changed using the <span style="font-family: monospace;">closeFromEitherEnd</span> configuration option.<br>
<h2>Opening Time</h2>
In SG-1, a stargate is able to stay open for a maximum time of 39
minutes. Since a Minecraft day and night is only 20 minutes, some
scaling down seems to be called for. The default maximum opening time
in SG Craft is somewhat arbitrarily set to 5 minutes. This can be
changed using the <span style="font-family: monospace;">secondsToStayOpen</span> configuration option.<br>
<h2>Power Source</h2>
It's not entirely clear where SG-1 stargates get their power from, but
a naquadah-powered generator seems a likely candidate, since naquadah
is used as a power source for other technology in the series. The
current solution in SG Craft of placing naquadah directly into the
stargate is temporary; a future version will probably incorprate a
naquadah generator into the DHD, as well as provide alternative means
of powering the gate.<br>
<h2>Number of Chevrons</h2>
Quite a number of people have pointed out that stargates are supposed
to have 9 chevrons, not 7. I hadn't noticed this before, because the
stargate in SG Command had two of them hidden behind the ramp, and
since they mostly only used 7-symbol addresses in the original series,
it never occurred to me that there might be more.<br>
<br>
Anyhow, 7 chevrons is a much more convenient number for SG Craft,
because it fits evenly around a 5x5 ring with a gap at the bottom. So
what I will probably do in a future version is provide an upgrade path
for adding another couple of chevrons to an existing gate, to give an
extended addressing range.<br>
<h2>Address Symbols</h2>
I know, I know, the symbols are meant to be constellations, not
hieroglyphs, and there are supposed to be 39 of them or thereabouts.
Well, SG Craft is just different in that area. In my version of the
backstory, the Goa'uld got their writing system from the Ancients, and
passed it on to the Egyptians. It seems at least as plausible as
pyramid-shaped starships and aliens with the names of Egyptian gods.<br>
<br>
I may provide an option for changing this at some point. In the meantime, you can change it using a texture pack if you want.<br>
